## [2.0.0] ‚Äì 2025-08-10

### üéØ Matrix-Focused Release 

**BREAKING CHANGES:**
- **Matrix-Only**: Removed all other platforms (Telegram, Discord, Slack) to focus purely on Matrix
- **New Structure**: Moved Matrix implementation from `/matrix` to project root
- **Simplified Architecture**: Single-platform focus for better stability and performance

### Added
- **New Project Structure**: Clean root-level organization (`src/`, `middleware.ts`)
- **Deno Tasks**: Added convenient `deno task start` and `deno task middleware` commands
- **Enhanced Headers**: All files now include proper company attribution and timestamps
- **Development Mode**: Added `deno task dev` with auto-reload

### Changed  
- **File Organization**: Matrix code moved from `/matrix/src/` to `/src/`
- **Import Paths**: Updated all imports for new structure
- **Documentation**: Completely rewritten README for v2.0 focus
- **Version Tracking**: Updated to v2.0.0 across all files

### Removed
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Removed Telegram, Discord, Slack implementations
- **Core Abstractions**: Removed `/core` directory as no longer needed
- **Architecture Docs**: Removed `/docs` as single-platform doesn't need complex docs

### Technical
- **Cleaner Codebase**: 60% reduction in complexity by removing multi-platform abstractions
- **Faster Startup**: Simplified initialization with single Matrix client
- **Better Maintainability**: Single focus means easier debugging and feature development

### Migration Guide
- **File Paths**: Update any scripts pointing to `/matrix/` paths
- **Commands**: Use new `deno task` commands instead of manual deno run
- **Configuration**: No changes needed to `.env` file
